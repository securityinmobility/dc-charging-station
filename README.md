# dc-charging-station

This repository contains glue code in order to create a fully working DC charging station.

In our case we use [SwitchEV/josev](https://github.com/SwitchEV/josev) for the ISO15118 stack, an [EVAcharge SE](https://chargebyte.com/products/charging-station-communication/evacharge-se) for powerline communication and a [Kratzer Automation battery tester](https://www.ni.com/de/shop/power-electronics-test-systems.html) as a HV power supply.
